                        <p><span>Student Rights is a student-led department within IUSG with the mission of advocating for and protecting the rights of students on our campus. We primarily accomplish this goal by working with individual students and student groups who have been accused of academic or personal misconduct.</span>

                            assisting students and student groups in the campus conduct system and 2) providing a
                            peer-to-peer mediation service in order to resolve conflicts between roommates, neighbors,
                            or other students on campus. We offer free and confidential help to students for:</p>
